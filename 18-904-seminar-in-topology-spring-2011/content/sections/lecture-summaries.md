The class meets for one hour three times a week. After an introductory lecture on the main topics by the instructor, student will prepare lectures to present to the rest of the class related to that topic.

In each class session, two students will give lectures. Each lecture should be about 25 minutes long. Individual lectures will not be graded, but lectures make up a good portion of the final grade. Members of the audience will write up observations about each lecture they observe. These comments will be forwarded to the lecturing student anonymously.

Readings references are to the two required texts:

| 1 | Organizational meeting | The first meeting of class. |
| 2 | Introduction to the fundamental group | Give the idea of the fundamental group and some basic examples. Also give the idea of homotopy equivalences and some basic examples. |
| 3 | Paths and homotopies |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Define what a **path** in a space is, and what a **homotopy** of paths is. Showthat "homotopic"; is an equivalence relation on paths. Give an example of a homotopy between two paths. Give an example of two paths with the same endpoints which are not homotopic (proof not required). Define the **composition** of two paths, and show that it is well-defined on homotopy classes of paths. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} _References_: Hatcher §1.1, Massey §II.2. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| &nbsp; | The fundamental group |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Define the **fundamental group** of a topological space and prove that it is a group. Give an example of a space whose fundamental group is trivial and an example of a space whose fundamental group is non-trivial (without proofs). Show that a path between two points induces an isomorphism between the fundamental groups based at those points. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} _References_: Hatcher §1.1, Massey §II.3. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| 4 | The fundamental group of the circle | Define a homomorphism Z→ π1(S1) and show that it is an isomorphism. |
| &nbsp; | Applications of previous lecture |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Using the isomorphism π1(S1) = Z from the previous lecture, prove the following theorems: the fundamental theorem of algebra (every non-constant polynomial with complex coefficients has a complex root), Brouwer's fixed point theorem for the 2-disc (every continuous map from the 2-disc to itself has a fixed point) and the Borsuk-Ulam theorem for the 2-sphere (every continuous map from the 2-sphere to **R**2 admits two antipodal points at which it is equal). {{< br >}}{{< br >}} _References_: Hatcher §1.1, Massey §II.6. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| 5 | Contractible and simply connected spaces | Define what it means for a space to be **contractible** and **simply connected**. Prove that a contractible space is simply connected. Show that **R**n is contractible. Show that a sphere of dimension at least 2 is simply connected. (Spheres are _not_ contractible though!) |
| &nbsp; | The fundamental group of a product |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Show that the fundamental group of the cartesian product of two spaces is the direct product of the fundamental groups of the two spaces. Compute the fundamental groups of tori. (A **torus** is just a product of circles.) {{< br >}}{{< br >}} _References_: Hatcher §1.1, Massey §II.7. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| 6 | Functoriality of the fundamental group | Show that a continuous map f : X → Y of topological spaces induces a homomorphism of groups f\* : π1(X) → π1(Y). Define what it means for two maps f, g : X → Y to be **homotopic** (generalizing the definition for paths). Show that if f and g are homotopic then f\*=g\*. |
| &nbsp; | Homotopy equivalences |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Define what a **homotopy equivalence** between two spaces is. Show that if two spaces are homotopy equivalent then their fundamental groups are isomorphic.
